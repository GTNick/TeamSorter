Description
============
Ever needed to sort your players into 2 even teams for TeamPVP? Use this! It sorts players into either Red Team or Blue Team, making sure there are an even amount of players in each team, players nametags are changed to the colour of their team, and they can't hurt other members of their team, as well as spawning players in armour the colour of their team! When a player dies they also automatically change teams, although sometimes the sorter may leave it in the same team. There is another feature which automatically spawns them with armour the colour of their team, and you can customize all the other items they spawn with. This doesn't even require a seperate TeamPVP plugin, it has all the necessary features on its own already.
